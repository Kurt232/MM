      "Okay, so I have this problem about a tank with salt solution, and I need to figure out how much salt is in the tank after 100 minutes. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the tank initially has 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. So, the concentration of salt in the tank at the start is 3 grams per 100 liters, which is 0.03 grams per liter. Got that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's this salt solution being sprayed into the tank. The sprayed solution has 0.02 grams of salt per liter. The rate is 4 liters per minute. So, every minute, 4 liters of this solution with 0.02 grams per liter is added to the tank. That means the amount of salt added per minute is 4 * 0.02 = 0.08 grams per minute. Okay, so the tank is getting 0.08 grams of salt every minute from the spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the tank is also mixing and flowing out at the same rate of 4 liters per minute. So, the volume of the tank remains constant, right? Because it's being filled at 4 liters per minute and drained at 4 liters per minute. So, the volume is always 100 liters. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the question is about the amount of salt in the tank after 100 minutes. Hmm, so I think this is a mixing problem where the concentration changes over time as salt is added and also some mixture is removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that for these kinds of problems, the concept of steady-state or differential equations might be useful. Let me recall. The rate of change of salt in the tank is equal to the rate at which salt is added minus the rate at which salt is removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, mathematically, that would be dS/dt = rate in - rate out.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the rate in? The salt is being added at 0.08 grams per minute, right? So, that's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the rate out? The mixture is flowing out at 4 liters per minute, and the concentration of salt in the tank at any time t is S(t) grams per 100 liters. So, the concentration is S(t)/100. Therefore, the rate at which salt is leaving the tank is 4 liters per minute times (S(t)/100) grams per liter, which is (4 * S(t))/100 = 0.04 * S(t) grams per minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the differential equation is:\n",
      "\n",
      "dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 * S(t)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a first-order linear differential equation. I think I can solve this using an integrating factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standard form is dS/dt + P(t) * S = Q(t). In this case, it's dS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, P(t) is 0.04, and Q(t) is 0.08. Since P(t) is constant, the integrating factor is e^(∫0.04 dt) = e^(0.04t).\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor:\n",
      "\n",
      "e^(0.04t) * dS/dt + 0.04 * e^(0.04t) * S = 0.08 * e^(0.04t)\n",
      "\n",
      "The left side is the derivative of (e^(0.04t) * S) with respect to t. So, integrating both sides:\n",
      "\n",
      "∫ d/dt (e^(0.04t) * S) dt = ∫ 0.08 e^(0.04t) dt\n",
      "\n",
      "So, e^(0.04t) * S = (0.08 / 0.04) * e^(0.04t) + C\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplify the right side: 0.08 / 0.04 is 2, so:\n",
      "\n",
      "e^(0.04t) * S = 2 e^(0.04t) + C\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide both sides by e^(0.04t):\n",
      "\n",
      "S(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, apply the initial condition. At t=0, S(0) = 3 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 3 = 2 + C e^(0) => 3 = 2 + C => C = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the solution is S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The integrating factor was e^(0.04t), and after integrating, we had e^(0.04t) * S = 2 e^(0.04t) + C. So, dividing both sides by e^(0.04t) gives S(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04t). That seems right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, plugging in t=0, S(0)=3=2 + C, so C=1. So, S(t)=2 + e^(-0.04t). Okay, that seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the question is asking for the amount of salt after 100 minutes. So, plug t=100 into S(t):\n",
      "\n",
      "S(100) = 2 + e^(-0.04*100) = 2 + e^(-4).\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the options, that's option D: 2 + e^-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because the initial concentration is 0.03 g/L, and we're adding 0.02 g/L at 4 L/min, and removing 4 L/min of the mixture. So, intuitively, the amount of salt should approach a steady state. Since the inflow concentration is lower than the initial concentration, the salt should decrease over time but approach a value where the inflow equals the outflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but according to the solution, S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t). So, as t approaches infinity, S(t) approaches 2 grams. So, the salt is approaching 2 grams. But initially, it was 3 grams, so it's decreasing towards 2 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the inflow is 0.02 g/L, and the outflow is 4 L/min with concentration S(t)/100. So, the net change is 0.08 g/min minus 0.04*S(t). So, the differential equation is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me think about the steady state. If it approaches 2 grams, then the concentration is 0.02 g/L, which is the same as the inflow concentration. So, that makes sense because if the concentration in the tank is 0.02 g/L, then the outflow rate is 4 L/min * 0.02 g/L = 0.08 g/min, which is equal to the inflow rate. So, the system reaches a steady state at 2 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the solution S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t) is correct because it approaches 2 as t approaches infinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after 100 minutes, S(100) = 2 + e^(-4). So, the answer should be D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. 2\n",
      "\n",
      "B. 2 - e^-2\n",

      "C. 2 + e^-2\n",
      "\n",
      "D. 2 + e^-4\n",
      "\n",
      "So, D is 2 + e^-4, which is what I got. So, that's the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure, let me think about the process again. The tank is 100 L, adding 4 L/min of 0.02 g/L salt, so 0.08 g/min added, and removing 4 L/min of the mixture. So, the net change is 0.08 - 0.04*S(t). So, the differential equation is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving it gives S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t). So, at t=100, it's 2 + e^(-4). So, yeah, D is correct.\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this problem here about salt solutions and mixing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the setup is: there's a tank with 100 liters of water and 3 grams of salt dissolved in it. Then, another salt solution is being sprayed into the tank. The sprayed solution has 0.02 grams per liter. The spraying rate is 4 liters per minute. The mixture is well-mixed, and it flows out at the same rate, 4 liters per minute. The question is, after 100 minutes, how many grams of salt are in the tank?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, wait. Wait a second. So the tank is both receiving more solution and losing solution. So the volume is constant? Because in and out are both 4 liters per minute. So the total volume in the tank remains 100 liters. That's an important point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that for these kinds of problems, the key is to look at the rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank. So, maybe I should model this with a differential equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote the amount of salt in the tank at any time t as S(t). The rate at which salt is entering the tank is from the sprayed solution. The sprayed solution has 0.02 grams per liter, and it's being added at 4 liters per minute. So the rate in is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 grams per minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the tank is also losing solution at 4 liters per minute. The concentration of salt in the tank at time t is S(t)/100 grams per liter. So the rate at which salt leaves the tank is (S(t)/100) g/L * 4 L/min = (4S(t)/100) g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the net rate of change of salt in the tank is the rate in minus rate out. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "dS/dt = rate in - rate out\n",
      "dS/dt = 0.08 - (4 S(t)/100)\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplify that: 0.08 is 8/100, so 8/100 - (4 S(t)/100) = (8 -4 S(t))/100.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the differential equation is dS/dt = (8 -4 S)/100.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The incoming solution is 0.02 g/L, 4 L/min, so 0.08 g/min. The outgoing solution is 4 L/min, with concentration S(t)/100, so 4*(S(t)/100) = 0.04 S(t) g/min. So the net change is 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). So yes, dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t).\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in my initial calculation, I think I messed up the units. Let me redo that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, 4 L/min is the flow rate. The concentration is S(t) grams per 100 L. So the outflow is (S(t)/100 g/L) * 4 L/min = (4 S(t))/100 g/min. So 4/100 is 0.04. So yes, 0.04 S(t) g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the differential equation is correct: dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a linear ordinary differential equation. The standard form is dS/dt + k S = C, where k is the rate constant and C is the constant term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in this case, it's dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S. So rearranged, dS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integrating factor method can be used here. The integrating factor (IF) is e^(∫0.04 dt) = e^(0.04 t).\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiply both sides by IF:\n",
      "\n",
      "e^(0.04 t) dS/dt + 0.04 e^(0.04 t) S = 0.08 e^(0.04 t)\n",
      "\n",
      "The left side is the derivative of (S(t) * e^(0.04 t)) with respect to t. So integrate both sides:\n",
      "\n",
      "∫ d/dt [S e^{0.04 t}] dt = ∫ 0.08 e^{0.04 t} dt\n",

      "Right side: 0.08 ∫ e^{0.04 t} dt = 0.08 * (1/0.04) e^{0.04 t} + C2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So:\n",
      "\n",
      "S e^{0.04 t} = (0.08 / 0.04) e^{0.04 t} + C\n",

      "S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}\n",

      "Now, apply the initial condition. At t=0, S(0) = 3 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "So 3 = 2 + C e^{0} → 3 = 2 + C → C=1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the solution is S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because 0.04 t is the exponent. So S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, let me double-check the integration steps. Because when I integrated the right side, I think I might have made a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the integral of e^{a t} dt is (1/a) e^{a t} + C. So 0.08 ∫ e^{0.04 t} dt = 0.08 * (1/0.04) e^{0.04 t} = 2 e^{0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the equation becomes S e^{0.04 t} = 2 e^{0.04 t} + C.\n",
      "\n",
      "So S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with S(0)=3, 3=2 + C → C=1.\n",

      "So S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, the problem says the tank initially has 3 grams. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the question is, what is S(100) ?\n",
      "\n",
      "So plug t=100 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "S(100) = 2 + e^{-0.04 * 100} = 2 + e^{-4}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 2 + e^{-4}, which would be the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because the initial condition is 3 grams, which is 3 = 2 + C → C=1. So S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at t=100, S=2 + e^{-4}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the options, option D is 2 + e^{-4}, which is option D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, let me think about the units. The time is in minutes, and the exponent is 0.04 per minute. So 0.04 * 100 =4, so e^{-4} is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer should be D) 2 + e^{-4}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, let me think about the setup again. The initial solution is 3 grams in 100 liters. Then, the inflow is 4 L/min of 0.02 g/L, so 0.08 g/min. The outflow is 4 L/min, so the volume remains 100 L.\n",

A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this problem here about salt solutions and mixing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the tank initially has 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. Then, another salt solution is being sprayed into the tank. The sprayed solution has 0.02 grams per liter. The spraying rate is 4 liters per minute. The mixture is well-mixed, and it flows out at the same rate, 4 liters per minute. The question is, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, wait. So, the tank is both receiving more salt solution and losing mixture. So it's a continuous process. I remember that for these kinds of problems, the concept of steady-state or using differential equations might come into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any time t as S(t). The volume of the solution in the tank at time t is V(t). Since the inflow is 4 L/min and outflow is 4 L/min, the volume remains constant. Oh wait, because the inflow and outflow rates are the same, so V(t) is always 100 liters. That's a key point. So the volume doesn't change over time. That simplifies things a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the concentration of salt in the tank at time t is S(t)/V(t) = S(t)/100 grams per liter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the inflow is a salt solution at 0.02 grams per liter. So the amount of salt coming in per minute is 4 L/min * 0.02 g/L = 0.08 grams per minute. So the rate at which salt is added is +0.08 g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outflow is 4 L/min, and the concentration is S(t)/100 g/L. So the amount of salt leaving per minute is 4 * (S(t)/100) = (4S(t))/100 = 0.04 S(t) g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the net rate of change of salt in the tank is the inflow minus outflow. So dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t).\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this question about the cranial capacity of Homo erectus. Hmm, I remember that cranial capacity refers to the volume of the skull, right? I think it's measured in cubic centimeters. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but I'll try to think it through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I've heard that modern humans have a cranial capacity around 1350-1450 cc. But Homo erectus is an earlier species, so their capacity should be less. I think they were around 1.5 million years ago or something. Oh right, they're known for having a more robust skull structure compared to earlier hominids.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember reading that the average cranial capacity for Homo erectus is somewhere between 800 to maybe 1350 cc. But wait, I'm not sure if it's higher or lower. Let me think about some examples. I think some sources say that the average is about 1100-1300 cc. But I'm a bit confused because I've also heard that some individuals might have had larger or smaller capacities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: I think the term \"cranial capacity\" can vary based on the specific individual. So the average would be a range. But the options here are specific numbers. Let me look at the options again.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, if the average is around 1100-1350, then 1200 and 1350 are in that range. But wait, I thought Homo erectus was smaller than us. Oh, right, their brain size was about 75-85% of ours. So if modern humans are around 1350, then 0.75 * 1350 is about 1012.5. So maybe around 1000? But wait, that's the brain volume, not the cranial capacity. Wait, no, cranial capacity is the volume of the skull, which includes the brain and other structures. So maybe the brain size is a bit less than the cranial capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The brain size of Homo erectus was estimated to be about 1.2-1.4 times that of Australopithecus, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the average cranial capacity for Homo erectus is around 1200-1350 cc. So looking at the options, D is 1350, which is the higher end. But I also remember that some sources say the average is around 1100-1300, so 1200 is in that range.\n",

      "Wait, another thought: I think the maximum size was around 1700, but that's for the larger individuals. The average would be lower. So 1700 is probably the maximum, so C is 1700, but that's the maximum, not the average. So the question is about the approximate mean, so the average.\n",

Their brain size was estimated to be about 75-85% of that of modern humans. If modern humans have a cranial capacity of approximately 1350 cc, then *Homo erectus* brain size would be roughly 0.75 × 1350 = 1012.5 cc.

      "Okay, so I've got these two multiple-choice questions here, and I need to figure them out. Let's take them one at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First question: It's about the force on a point pole. Hmm, I remember that the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by the formula F = I * L × B. Oh wait, but wait, the question says the pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 Weber. Wait, Weber is the unit of magnetic flux, right? So magnetic flux Φ = B * A * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the area. But here, the pole's strength is given as 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 Weber. Wait, no, wait, the question says 4π * 10^-4 Weber. Oh, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the question says: \"A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber.\" Oh, so Φ = 4π × 1e-4 Weber. Wait, no, 4π × 1e-4? Or is it 4π × 1.5e-4? Wait, the question says 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 Weber. Oh, no, wait, the first part says 4π * 10^-4 Weber, and the second part says 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 Weber. Wait, no, the question says: \"A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be...\" Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the first sentence: \"A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber.\" So Φ1 = 4π × 1e-4 Wb. The second part says: \"a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber.\" So Φ2 = 4π × 1.5e-4 Wb. So the second pole has a flux of 1.5 times the first one. Wait, but wait, the question is about the force on the second pole when placed at a distance of 10 cm from the first pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait, the formula for the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is F = I * L × B. But wait, the pole is a point, so maybe it's a magnetic pole, like a magnet. Oh, right, the pole's strength is related to its magnetic dipole moment. The magnetic field at a point due to a pole is given by B = (μ0 * M) / (4π r^3), where M is the magnetic moment. But wait, the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is F = I L × B. But in this case, the pole itself is the source of the magnetic field, so maybe it's about the magnetic force on a current loop or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the question is about the force between two magnetic poles. Oh, right, the force between two magnetic poles is given by F = (μ0 * M1 * M2) / (4π r^3). But wait, that's when they are aligned. Or is it when they are opposite? Wait, the force between two magnetic poles is F = (μ0/(4π)) * (M1 M2) / r^3 when they are aligned. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the force on a current loop in a magnetic field is F = I * (L × B). But in this case, the pole is a magnet, so maybe the question is about the force on a current in a wire placed near the pole. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the question says the pole has a strength of 4π × 1e-4 Weber. Wait, Weber is magnetic flux, which is Φ = B * A. So if the pole's strength is Φ = 4π × 1e-4 Wb, then the magnetic field at a distance r is B = Φ/(A), but wait, no, because Φ = B * A. So if the pole is a point, perhaps it's a magnetic dipole, and the field at a distance r is B = (μ0/(4π)) * (M) / r^3, where M is the magnetic moment.\n",

      "Wait, but the question is about the force on a second pole placed at 10 cm distance. So perhaps the second pole is a magnet with flux Φ2 = 4π × 1.5e-4 Wb. So the magnetic moment M is Φ/(2A), but wait, for a point pole, the magnetic moment M is given by M = Φ/(2A), where A is the area. But wait, if the pole is a point, perhaps the area is taken as a small loop, so A is the area of that loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the magnetic force on a current loop. Let me think again. The force on a current loop in a magnetic field is F = I * (L × B).

But if the poles are point-like, perhaps the area is taken as a small loop, so A is the area of that loop. But without knowing the area, how can we proceed? Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming that the area is the same for both poles, or perhaps it's a different approach.\n",

      "Wait, perhaps the question is about the magnetic force on a current in a wire placed near the pole. So if a wire carrying current I is placed near a magnetic pole, the force on the wire is F = I * L × B. The B here is the magnetic field at the point where the wire is placed due to the pole.

      "Okay, so I have this problem about a tank with a salt solution. Let me try to understand what's going on here. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the tank initially has 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. That means the initial concentration is 3 grams per 100 liters, which is 0.03 grams per liter. But then, they start spraying another salt solution into the tank. This solution has 0.02 grams of salt per liter and is being added at a rate of 4 liters per minute. At the same time, the mixture is being mixed instantly and flowing out at the same rate of 4 liters per minute. So, the volume in the tank remains constant at 100 liters because the inflow and outflow rates are equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is asking how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this seems like a classic mixing problem, probably involving differential equations. I remember that for these kinds of problems, we can model the amount of salt in the tank over time using a differential equation that accounts for the rate at which salt is entering and leaving the tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote the amount of salt in the tank at time t as S(t). The volume of the tank is constant at 100 liters, so the concentration at any time t is S(t)/100 grams per liter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the rate at which salt enters the tank is the concentration of the incoming solution multiplied by the inflow rate. The incoming solution has a concentration of 0.02 grams per liter, and it's flowing in at 4 liters per minute. So, the rate in is 0.02 * 4 = 0.08 grams per minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate at which salt leaves the tank is the concentration of the mixture in the tank multiplied by the outflow rate. The concentration in the tank is S(t)/100, and the outflow rate is also 4 liters per minute. So, the rate out is (S(t)/100) * 4 = (4S(t))/100 = 0.04S(t) grams per minute.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at the options, D is 2 + e^-4. So, that should be the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me think again. The initial concentration is 3 grams in 100 liters, which is 0.03 g/L. The inflow is 0.02 g/L. So, the inflow is less concentrated than the initial solution. So, over time, the concentration in the tank should approach 0.02 g/L, which is 2 grams in 100 liters. So, the amount of salt should approach 2 grams. \n",
      "\n",
      "But initially, it's 3 grams, so it's decreasing towards 2 grams. So, after 100 minutes, it should be slightly above 2 grams because the exponential term e^(-4) is a small positive number. So, 2 + e^(-4) is correct, which is option D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the inflow concentration was higher, the salt would increase towards that higher concentration, but in this case, it's lower, so the salt decreases towards 2 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check the differential equation again. Maybe I messed up the signs.\n",
      "\n",
      "dS/dt = rate in - rate out. Rate in is 0.08, rate out is 0.04 S(t). So, dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). That's correct because if S(t) is higher than 2 grams, the rate out is higher, so dS/dt is negative, meaning S(t) decreases. If S(t) is less than 2, dS/dt is positive, so S(t) increases towards 2. So, the equilibrium is 2 grams, which makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, solving the equation, we get S(t) = 2 + (3 - 2) e^(-0.04t) = 2 + e^(-0.04t). So, after 100 minutes, it's 2 + e^(-4). So, D is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the options are A. 2, B. 2 - e^-2, C. 2 + e^-2, D. 2 + e^-4.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, D is 2 + e^-4, which is what I got. So, that's the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I should check if the time constant is different. The differential equation is dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t). The time constant is 1/0.04 = 25 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, which is 4 time constants, the exponential term is e^(-4). So, yeah, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think the answer is D.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem involves a tank with an initial salt concentration that changes over time due to inflow and outflow of salt solutions. By setting up and solving a differential equation, we find that the amount of salt in the tank approaches an equilibrium value. After 100 minutes, the amount of salt is given by 2 + e^(-4) grams.\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this problem about a tank with a salt solution, and I need to figure out how much salt is in the tank after 100 minutes. Hmm, let's see. I remember this is a mixing problem, probably involving differential equations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, the tank initially has 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water. So the initial concentration is 3g/100L, which is 0.03 g/L. Then, there's another salt solution being added. This solution has 0.02 g/L of salt and is sprayed into the tank at 4 liters per minute. The mixture is well-mixed, and the solution flows out at the same rate, 4 L/min. So the volume in the tank remains constant at 100 liters because the inflow and outflow rates are equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so the volume is constant. That might simplify things. Because if the volume isn't changing, the concentration just depends on the amount of salt in the tank at any time t.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the setup. The rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) should be equal to the rate at which salt is entering minus the rate at which it's leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salt is entering from the inflow. The inflow rate is 4 L/min, and the concentration is 0.02 g/L. So the rate in is (0.02 g/L) * (4 L/min) = 0.08 g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salt is leaving because the mixture is flowing out at 4 L/min. The concentration of the mixture is S(t)/100, since S(t) is the grams of salt in 100 liters. So the rate out is (S(t)/100 g/L) * 4 L/min = (4 S(t))/100 = 0.04 S(t) g/min.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it together, the differential equation is:\n",
      "\n",
      "dS/dt = (rate in) - (rate out) = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, that's a linear differential equation. I think I can solve this using an integrating factor. The standard form is dS/dt + P(t) S = Q(t). Let me rearrange the equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "dS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's right. So P(t) is 0.04, and Q(t) is 0.08.\n",

      "e^(0.04 t) dS/dt + 0.04 e^(0.04 t) S = 0.08 e^(0.04 t)\n",

      "\n",
      "∫ d(S e^(0.04 t)) = ∫ 0.08 e^(0.04 t) dt\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrate the right side. Let me compute that integral. Let u = 0.04 t, so du = 0.04 dt. Hmm, but 0.08 is 2 * 0.04. So 0.08 e^(u) * (dt) = 2 * 0.04 e^u dt = 2 e^u du. So the integral becomes 2 e^u + C, which is 2 e^(0.04 t) + C.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the left side is S e^(0.04 t) = 2 e^(0.04 t) + C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide both sides by e^(0.04 t):\n",
      "\n",
      "S(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04 t)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, apply the initial condition. At t=0, S(0) = 3 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "So 3 = 2 + C e^(0) → 3 = 2 + C → C = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the solution is S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04 t).\n",

      "Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup. The inflow is 0.02 g/L, 4 L/min, so 0.08 g/min. The outflow is 4 L/min, so the concentration is S(t)/100, so 0.04 S(t) g/min. So the DE is correct.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this question about the mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my paleoanthropology, but I'll try to think it through.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that cranial capacity refers to the volume of the skull, which is often used as an indicator of brain size. So, Homo erectus is an extinct species in the genus Homo, right? They were around a long time ago, maybe from about 2 million years ago up to about 700,000 years ago or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think modern humans, Homo sapiens, have a cranial capacity around 1300-1400 cc on average. But wait, I've heard that Homo erectus had a smaller brain than us. Or was it larger? No, wait, no. I think their brains were smaller than ours. Because as we evolved, brain size increased. So, if modern humans are about 1350-1400, then Homo erectus must be lower than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that some sources say that Homo erectus had a cranial capacity of around 800-1000 cc. Or was that another species? Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up with Homo habilis. Homo habilis had a smaller brain, like around 500-600 cc. So Homo erectus is the next step up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if Homo habilis is about 500-600, then Homo erectus is higher. I think the average for Homo erectus is around 800-1000 cc. But wait, I've also heard that some individuals might have had capacities up to 1200 or so. But the mean, the average, is probably lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the options, let's see. The options are:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. 1200 cc\n",

      "And I need to find the maximum possible value of e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, so I'm thinking about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with sums and sums of squares, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the method of Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But since this is a problem likely intended for a competition or an exam, maybe there's a simpler approach using basic algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me consider the variables a, b, c, d. Since I want to maximize e, perhaps I can express the sum and sum of squares in terms of e and then find the constraints on e.\n",

      "I remember that for real numbers, the sum of squares is minimized when all the numbers are equal. So, to minimize Q, given that a + b + c + d = S, each of a, b, c, d should be equal to S/4.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the minimum possible value of Q is 4*(S/4)² = (S²)/4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check that. If all four variables are equal, then each is S/4. So each squared is (S²)/16, and four of them sum to 4*(S²/16) = S²/4. Yes, that's correct.\n",

      "So, the sum of squares Q must be at least S²/4. But in our case, Q is 16 - e². So, 16 - e² must be greater than or equal to (S²)/4.\n",

      "Let me rearrange it:\n",
      "\n",
      "5e² -16e ≤ 0\n",

      "So, 5e² -16e ≤ 0.\n",

      "I can factor this as e*(5e -16) ≤ 0.\n",

      "1. e ≤ 0 and (5e -16) ≥ 0, which would require e ≤0 and 5e ≥16 → e ≥16/5. But 16/5 is 3.2, which is positive, so e can't be both ≤0 and ≥3.2. So this case is impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Or, e ≥0 and (5e -16) ≤0. So, e ≥0 and 5e ≤16 → e ≤16/5.\n",

      "So, the solution is 0 ≤ e ≤16/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait a second. Because the inequality is 5e² -16e ≤0, which is equivalent to e(5e -16) ≤0. So, the product is ≤0 when one factor is positive and the other is negative.\n",

      "So, the critical points are e=0 and e=16/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the intervals are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- e <0: Let's pick e=-1. Then, e is negative, 5e-16 is negative (since 5*(-1) =-5, -5-16=-21). So, product is positive. So, not satisfying the inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 0 < e <16/5: Let's pick e=2. Then, e is positive, 5e-16=10-16=-6. So, product is negative. So, satisfies the inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "- e>16/5: Let's pick e=4. Then, e is positive, 5e-16=20-16=4. So, product is positive. Doesn't satisfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the inequality holds when e is between 0 and 16/5, inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait. The original problem is to find the maximum value of e. So, according to this, the maximum e can be is 16/5, which is 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me make sure that this is achievable. Because sometimes, when you set up inequalities, you might get a bound, but you have to check if equality is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when e=16/5, then S=8 - e = 8 - 16/5 = (40/5 -16/5)=24/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, S=24/5, which is 4.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Q=16 - e² = 16 - (256/25) = (400/25 -256/25)=144/25.\n",

      "So, Q=144/25.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the minimum possible Q for a, b, c, d is S²/4 = (24/5)^2 /4 = (576/25)/4 = 144/25.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is exactly equal to Q. So, that means that a, b, c, d must all be equal to S/4 = (24/5)/4 = 6/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, a = b = c = d =6/5.\n",

      "\n",
      "a + b + c + d + e = 4*(6/5) +16/5 = 24/5 +16/5=40/5=8. Correct.\n",

      "Sum of squares: 4*(6/5)^2 + (16/5)^2 =4*(36/25) +256/25=144/25 +256/25=400/25=16. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yes, e can indeed be 16/5, which is 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but wait a second. The initial approach was to find the minimum Q given S, which is when all a, b, c, d are equal. So, that gives the minimal Q, which in turn gives the maximum possible e.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is there a possibility that e could be larger if a, b, c, d are not all equal? Because if a, b, c, d are not equal, their sum of squares could be larger, which would allow e² to be smaller, but wait, we're trying to maximize e, so we need e² to be as large as possible, which would require Q to be as small as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Because Q =16 - e². So, to maximize e, we need to minimize Q. So, the minimal Q is when a, b, c, d are equal, which gives the minimal Q, thus allowing e² to be as large as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that's why the maximum e is 16/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have a, b, c, d not all equal. Then, their sum of squares would be larger than S²/4. So, Q would be larger, which would mean e² =16 - Q would be smaller, so e would be smaller. So, to maximize e, we need Q to be as small as possible, which occurs when a, b, c, d are equal. So, that's why the maximum e is 16/5.\n",

      "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of e, given that a, b, c, d, e are real numbers. The conditions are that their sum is 8, and the sum of their squares is 16. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that when dealing with sums and sums of squares, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality might come into play. Or maybe it's something related to the relationship between the arithmetic mean and the quadratic mean. Let me try to recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem gives me two equations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. a + b + c + d + e = 8\n",
      "2. a² + b² + c² + d² + e² = 16\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find the maximum possible value of e. So, I guess I should express the other variables in terms of e and then see what constraints that puts on e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote S = a + b + c + d. Then, from the first equation, S + e = 8, so S = 8 - e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the sum of squares: let Q = a² + b² + c² + d². Then, Q + e² = 16, so Q = 16 - e².\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have four variables a, b, c, d with sum S = 8 - e and sum of squares Q = 16 - e². I need to find the maximum e such that these conditions are possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that for real numbers, the sum of squares is minimized when all the numbers are equal. So, to minimize Q, a, b, c, d should all be equal. That would give me the smallest possible Q for a given S, which in turn would allow e to be as large as possible because Q would be as small as possible, leaving more room for e².\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if a = b = c = d = k, then 4k = S = 8 - e, so k = (8 - e)/4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the sum of squares Q would be 4k² = 4*((8 - e)/4)² = 4*(64 - 16e + e²)/16 = (64 - 16e + e²)/4 = 16 - 4e + (e²)/4.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we also have Q = 16 - e². So, setting them equal:\n",

      "Wait, but e can't be 0 because that would give a larger e possible? Or is 3.2 the maximum? Let me check.\n",
      "\n",
      "If e = 16/5, which is 3.2, then S = 8 - 16/5 = (40 - 16)/5 = 24/5 = 4.8. So each of a, b, c, d would be 4.8 /4 = 1.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the sum of squares Q would be 4*(1.2)^2 = 4*(1.44) = 5.76. Then, e² is (16/5)^2 = 256/25 = 10.24. So total sum of squares is 5.76 + 10.24 = 16, which matches the given condition. So that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, is 16/5 the maximum possible e? Let me think if there's a way to get e larger than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose I don't set a, b, c, d equal. Maybe if some are larger and some are smaller, could that allow e to be larger? But I think that the minimal sum of squares occurs when all are equal, so if I make them unequal, the sum of squares Q would be larger, which would require e² to be smaller, meaning e would be smaller. So, to maximize e, I need to minimize Q, which happens when a, b, c, d are equal. So, e = 16/5 is indeed the maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The sum of a, b, c, d is S = 8 - e. The sum of their squares is Q = 16 - e².\n",
